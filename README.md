A practical,  catalog of security tools for students, red/blue teams, and builders. Focus is on widely used, well-maintained, and actually useful software across recon, web/API, cloud, containers, AD, DFIR, and more.

Format inspired by the structure and navigation style of my AI list. This one is tuned for security workflows and fast lookup.

## Compliance (Frameworks, How to Learn, Tools, Compliance-as-Code)

> Goal: understand frameworks, map controls to real telemetry, automate evidence, and continuously monitor. EU-centric bits included (NIS2/GDPR/DORA).

### Core Frameworks & Standards (know these)
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** — ISMS certification standard; Annex A controls; pair with **27002:2022** for guidance.  
  https://www.iso.org/standard/27001
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** — High-level Identify-Protect-Detect-Respond-Recover functions; profiles/tiers.  
  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5** — Catalog of security/privacy controls (US-centric but broadly referenced).  
  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp
- **CIS Controls v8** — 18 prioritized safeguards + IG1/IG2/IG3 maturity.  
  https://www.cisecurity.org/controls
- **SOC 2 (AICPA TSC)** — Trust Services Criteria (security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy).  
  https://www.aicpa.org
- **PCI DSS v4.0** — Cardholder data security for merchants/service providers.  
  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org
- **GDPR** — EU data protection regulation (law; not a cert).  
  https://gdpr.eu
- **NIS2 Directive (EU)** — Security of network & information systems; risk management & reporting for “essential/important” entities.  
  https://eur-lex.europa.eu
- **DORA (EU financial sector)** — Digital Operational Resilience Act; ICT risk for financial entities.  
  https://finance.ec.europa.eu/dora
- **HIPAA Security Rule (US healthcare)** — ePHI safeguards.  
  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa
- **Kubernetes Hardening (NSA/CISA)** — Practical K8s hardening guidance—tie to CIS K8s Benchmarks.  
  https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools

### How to Learn Compliance (practical track)

1. **Pick two frameworks**: one management (**ISO 27001** or **NIST CSF**) + one technical (**CIS Controls** or **800-53**). Learn their structure and vocabulary.
2. **Scope & asset inventory**: define boundaries; build an inventory (devices, apps, data flows, cloud accounts). Tools: **osquery**, **Open-AudIT**, **CloudQuery**.
3. **Risk management basics**: simple risk register (asset, threat, likelihood, impact, control). Use **ISO 27005** or **NIST 800-30** as structure.
4. **Control mapping**: create a control matrix mapping ISO 27001 Annex A ↔ CIS Controls ↔ NIST CSF. Keep it in Git (CSV/Markdown).
5. **Select policies**: start with **Acceptable Use, Access Control, Logging/Monitoring, Incident Response, Change Management, Secure Dev**. Version them in Git; link each to controls in your matrix.
6. **Implement telemetry**: enable logs & metrics that prove controls (e.g., MFA enforced, admin actions audited, EDR coverage %). Prefer **Elastic/OSSEC(Wazuh)/Defender/Sentinel** in labs.
7. **Evidence collection**: automate screenshots, config exports, and queries (e.g., Azure AD sign-in risk policy, AWS Config conformance). Store in a timestamped evidence folder per control.
8. **Continuous control monitoring (CCM)**: pick 10 controls (MFA, patch SLAs, backups tested, encryption at rest, etc.). Automate daily checks with **osquery**, **Wazuh**, cloud configs, and IaC scanners.
9. **Internal audit & SOA**: for ISO, maintain a Statement of Applicability; schedule internal audits; track corrective actions in an issue tracker (Jira/GitHub).
10. **Tabletop & incident drills**: run 2–3 tabletop exercises (ransomware, credential compromise, lost laptop). Record lessons learned as evidence for governance clauses.
